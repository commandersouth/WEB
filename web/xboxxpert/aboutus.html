        <h1>This is OUR Day One Promise to YOU!</h1>
        <p>
            We know you have many options when it comes to your news and review sources, and we appreciate you taking the time to stop by. The team here at Xbox Xpert want our passion for gaming and love of the Xbox brand to shine through. We're just gamers here, we're looking to share the excitement we have about the games, and the people and stories that make them with you. We aren't trying to shill for anybody, we just want to let you know what we really think! Whether it be a new headline, a new AAA, or a hidden indie gem. We look forward to taking this journey with you.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Our main focus for launch is to provide the most exciting news, and up to the minute reviews on all the new releases. We know you're busy and we strive to keep our coverage brief, and just hit the major beats from our stories, though we do want to provide our takes and engage with you on the topics in the comments (coming soon). For our reviews, we want to follow a similar idea, just hit the main points. Often times reviews can be long winded, I know I've scrolled to the bottom of a site's review just to catch the recap and the score. We strive to keep our reviews short enough that you'll just want to engage as is!
        </p>
        <p>   
            One of my favorite features from gaming websites I grew up on were polls, and we're sure to have some fun topics for all of our guests to throw their weight around on. And just like our reviews and news, we're looking forward to meeting you in the comments. This option will be hot on the heels of our launch, so stay tuned!
        </p>
        <p>    
            So what about comments? Isn't the internet a cesspool that will turn to hate in a matter of minutes? Likely. But we're not going to put up with it. We want Xbox Xpert to be an inviting community for gamers from all walks of life. We have strength in diversity, and we know it takes a "big man" to know when to hold their tongue. With that spirit, we want to keep it on topic. We welcome all views, but when that view becomes intolerance, it gets the boot. You are free to your opinions, but knowing when to share them is critical. No one is going to be persuaded from that one guy they read on an Xbox gaming website. So if the take is hot, and is likely to get someone riled up, it's likely best just to keep it to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>    
            With this in mind we want to give you the warmest of welcome to the newest kid on the block when it comes to Xbox content. We aren't in this to dominate anyone, we aren't here to argue with anyone. We are here because we love games, and we love the green brand. We want that loud and clear. All we are asking of ourselves is our best work, content we can be proud of producing. If we win awards, or get a large number of visitors, or whatever other positive outcome that may happen, those are all just pleasant side effects. At the end of the day, if we have done our best, and helped make someone's day a little brighter, whether it's through news, reviews, or community engagement, we've done our job. We hope you'll take this journey with us, we look forward to serving you and brining you the best content we can.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Thank you again for your patronage, and we'll see you ONLINE!
