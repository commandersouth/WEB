                Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard, one of the largest video game publishers in the world, for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal on January 18, 2022⁵. The deal would make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world and the largest headquartered in the Americas⁵. Microsoft said that the acquisition would accelerate its growth in gaming across mobile, PC, console and cloud and provide building blocks for the metaverse.
            </p>

                The deal faced regulatory scrutiny from several national anti-trust bodies, with early approvals granted by the European Commission and China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), among others⁵. The United States' Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued formal challenges to the acquisition, citing concerns over competition and consumer choice⁵. Sony also criticized the merger, worried that Microsoft would make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox⁵.

                The FTC withdrew its request after courts did not find their anti-trust compelling to block the merger, while Microsoft offered to offload its cloud gaming support for Activision Blizzard's games for ten years to Ubisoft to appease the CMA⁵. The deal was finalized on October 13, 2023, after receiving shareholder approval from both companies⁵.
            </p>
            <p>
                The acquisition includes iconic franchises from Activision Blizzard such as Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Overwatch and Candy Crush. Bobby Kotick will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard until a transition period is completed. Phil Spencer will become CEO of Activision Blizzard after that period and report to Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft..
